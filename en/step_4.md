## Step 2: A talking ChatBot

Now that you have a ChatBot with a personality, let's program it to talk to you.

+ Add code to your ChatBot so that when it's clicked it asks for your name, and then says "What a lovely name!".

    Test and save: your ChatBot should ask for your name and then tell you what a lovely name you have!

When the ChatBot __sprite is clicked__, it should __ask__ for your name. The ChatBot should then __say__ "What a lovely name!".

+ Your ChatBot simply replies "What a lovely name!" every time. Can you personalise your ChatBot's reply, by making use of the user's answer?

    Test and save: Your ChatBot should say hello using the user's name.

+ If you store the user's answer in a variable, then it can be used later. Create a new variable called `name` to store the user's name.

+ Can you store the user's answer in your `name` variable, and use it in your ChatBot's reply?

    Save and test: Your code should work as before, saying hello using the user's name.
