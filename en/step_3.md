## Step 1: Your ChatBot

+ Before you start making your chatbot, you need to decide on its personality. __Think about__:

	+ What is their name?
	+ Where do they live?
	+ Are they happy? serious? funny? shy? friendly?

+ Open a new empty Scratch project.

[[[generic-scratch-new-project]]]

+ Choose one of these character sprites, and add them to your project:
