+ Can you code your ChatBot to ask "Would you like to go to the moon?" and then change location if the user answers "yes"?

    Test and save: If you answer "yes", your ChatBot should change location. Your ChatBot should look sad and say "OK... bye!" if any other answer is given.

Your ChatBot should __ask__ the user "Would you like to go to the moon?". __If__ the user's __answer__ is "yes" then your ChatBot should __change costume__ to look happy and the stage __backdrop__ should change.

If the user answers "no", the ChatBot should __change costume__ to look sad and __say__ "OK...bye!"

You'll also need to add code to start your ChatBot in the right place when the __flag is clicked__.

+ Can you add code to make your ChatBot jump for joy if the user wants to go to the moon?

    Test and save: If your user answers "yes", your ChatBot should jump up and down. Your ChatBot shouldn't jump if any other answer is given.

Your ChatBot should jump by __changing__ its __y position__ by a small amount, and then changing its position back after a short __wait__. You may want to __repeat__ this a few times.
